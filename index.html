        Rock Climbing
      </h1>
      <div class="intro">
        Rock climbing is a sport in which participants climb up, down or across
        natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach
        the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route
        without falling.

        Most indoor climbing gyms will offer both of the following climbing
        options.

      <h2>Rope Climbing</h2>
      <p>
        <strong> Top rope climbing </strong> (or <strong>top roping</strong>) is
        a style in climbing in which the climber is securely attached to a rope
        which then passes up, through an anchor system at the top of the climb,
        and down to a belayer at the foot of the climb. The belayer takes in
        slack rope throughout the climb, so that if at any point the climber
        were to lose their hold, they would not fall more than a short distance

      <h2>Bouldering</h2>
      <span class="bouldering">
        <strong> Bouldering </strong> is a form of free climbing that is
        performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the
        use of ropes or harnesses. While bouldering can be done without any
        equipment, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds,
        chalk to keep their hands dry and to provide a firmer grip, and
        bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls.
